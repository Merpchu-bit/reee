There isn't realy anything to actually read.
Maybe other than a checklist I'll have for what I want done on this site
For now here is what I have:
Make a navebar-done
Make projects-done
Make Purpose-Done
Contacts photo-Done
Make About me-Done
Make more sites-Done
Choose a good navbar img-Done
Make a good color scheme for the site-Done
Present the finished product-Done

Ideas:
Make a search bar on the top right or left and connect it to a if statement so when the phrase,
"Give me my tools." is typed in, have a new tab on the nav bar show up, "Dev tools" where I can easily
add a new project, like title, description and img.
